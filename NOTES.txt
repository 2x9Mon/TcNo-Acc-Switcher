Developing:
Inside the TcNo-Acc-Switcher folder, make sure to run the following to run the program properly while debugging if you encounter issues:
1. dotnet new tool-manifest
[ Notice the new .config folder ]
2. dotnet tool install ElectronNET.CLI

If the program is complaining, you may need to copy "TcNoAccSw-Icon-100x100.png" into `TcNo-Acc-Switcher\obj\Host\bin`

If for some reason the program is unable to start again after debugging, it's likely still open. Try running `_KillAllElectron.bat` to stop electron and TcNo-Acc-Switcher
